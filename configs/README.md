# Configs

This directory contains configuration files for documenting your workflows, parameters, and settings used in your analyses.
Files that are commonly found here include YAML or JSON files that specify parameters for data processing pipelines or TSV/CSV files that list dataset information (e. g. dataset-level metadata, download URL etc.).

It is good practice to keep track of commonly used variables and parameters in configuration files, as this enhances reproducibility and makes it easier to share your workflows with others.
