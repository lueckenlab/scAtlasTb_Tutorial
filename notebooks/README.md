# Notebooks

This directory is for storing Jupyter notebooks that document your data analysis workflows, visualizations, and results. Notebooks are an excellent way to combine code, narrative text, and visualizations in a single document, making it easier to share and reproduce your analyses.

When creating notebooks, consider the following best practices:

- Use clear and descriptive titles for each notebook.
- Include narrative text to explain the purpose of the analysis, the methods used, and the interpretation of results.
- Organize code into cells with appropriate comments to enhance readability.
- Save notebooks with the `.ipynb` extension.
- Keep notebooks focused on specific tasks or analyses to maintain clarity and ease of navigation. Avoid overly long notebooks by breaking them into smaller, more manageable pieces when necessary.
- Beware of large amounts of images and incremental changes to binary outputs. Git does not handle these well, and it can bloat your repository size over time. Consider clearing output cells before committing notebooks to the repository.
